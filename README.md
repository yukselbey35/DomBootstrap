# What is Groovy for Jenkins?
Within a Pipeline Project (read plugin), Jenkins introduces a domain-specific language (DSL) based on 'Groovy', 
which can be used to define a new pipeline as a script. The flow that would typically require many “standard” 
Jenkins jobs chained together, can be expressed as a single script.
